This folder is for runtime assets used by the app (images, fonts, etc).

The login/welcome screen expects a PNG named: `welcome_meal.png` at this path.

To generate a tiny placeholder PNG (1Ã—1 transparent) run the included script:

  ./app/src/main/assets/create_welcome_png.sh

Or replace `welcome_meal.png` with your actual image (recommended sizes: 240-480 px wide for the welcome circle). For multiple densities, place appropriately-named files in `res/drawable-...` instead.
